#  CELA Chat Bot

CELA Chat bot is based on FAQ Plus Bot that can answer user's questions by searching the CELA sharepoint.  
| [Documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-faqplus/wiki/Home) | [Deployment guide](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-faqplus/wiki/Deployment-Guide) | [Architecture](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-faqplus/wiki/Solution-Overview) |

A user can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it's in the knowledge base. If not, the bot responds with options to contact CELA. 

**We could add features like by leveraging and extending the Expert CS project**
* Adding/editing/deleting/previewing QnA
* Viewing update history of QnA
* View all the existing QnA
* View the original version of the edited QnA
* View details of manually added QnA
